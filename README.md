# My CSS Practice Portfolio 🌐🎨

Welcome! This is a simple personal portfolio website that I built using **just HTML and CSS**. No JavaScript, no frameworks — just pure CSS to really get hands-on experience with how styling works from the ground up.

## 🧠 What's This About?

The whole idea behind this project is to **practice and explore core CSS concepts**. Instead of using libraries or other tech stacks, I wanted to focus entirely on writing clean, effective CSS and understanding how to bring a webpage to life with it.

## 💡 What You’ll See Here

- A clean and responsive layout
- A resume-style page with structured info
- Navigation bar with hover effects
- Gradients, shadows, custom fonts
- CSS transitions and animations
- All coded from scratch — no templates!
